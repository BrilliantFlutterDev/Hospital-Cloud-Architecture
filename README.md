Title: Hospital 
Introduction


	In today's healthcare environment, hospitals are under increasing pressure to improve efficiency, 
 reduce costs, and improve patient care. Cloud computing can help hospitals achieve these goals by 
 providing a scalable, reliable, and secure platform for storing and managing patient data. Cloud-based 
 systems can help hospitals automate many of their administrative tasks, such as scheduling appointments, 
 and staff and patientsâ€™ data. This can free up staff time to focus on patient care. Cloud-based systems 
 can help hospitals reduce their IT costs by eliminating the need to purchase and maintain their hardware 
 and software. Cloud-based systems can provide patients with access to their medical records from anywhere, 
 which can help improve communication between patients and providers. Cloud-based systems can also be used 
 to provide remote monitoring and care, which can help improve patient outcomes.
